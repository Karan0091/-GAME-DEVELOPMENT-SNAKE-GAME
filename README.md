#DESCRIPTION FOR GAME-DEVELOPMENT-SNAKE-GAME :

The Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, 
Eating food and growing longer with each item consumed. The objective is to keep the snake alive for as long as possible without colliding with the walls or itself.
Itâ€™s a simple yet engaging game that has stood the test of time due to its addictive gameplay and ease of understanding.
